       <p>Hello my name is Brett Hockridge. I'm 24 years old, love videogames, good food, love 
         spending time with my friends, family, and my amazing girlfriend. I also have a huge 
         passion for coding and really want to make it my career. I fell in love with coding 
         through video games. I always wanted to learn how to make them and the process it goes
         into making them.
