      <div id="aboutMeInfo">
       <p>Hello my name is Brett Hockridge. I grew up in Yorba Linda, California and have spent my whole life here.
          I'm 24 years old, love videogames, good food, love 
         spending time with my friends, family, and my amazing girlfriend. I also have a huge 
         passion for coding and really want to make it my career. I fell in love with coding 
         through video games. I always wanted to learn how to make them and the process that goes 
         into them. I know for a fact coding is what i want to do. I really enjoy everything about it. 
       </p>
